# budget-2025 - User Flows

## Primary User Flow: [Main Workflow]

### Happy Path
1. **User** opens the application
2. **System** displays [initial screen/dashboard]
3. **User** clicks/navigates to [main feature]
4. **System** shows [relevant interface]
5. **User** enters/selects [required information]
6. **System** validates input and provides feedback
7. **User** confirms/submits action
8. **System** processes and shows success state
9. **User** can continue with next action or navigate away

### Alternative Flows
- **Error Handling**: What happens if validation fails
- **Empty State**: What user sees when no data exists
- **Loading State**: How system behaves during processing

## Secondary Flows

### Flow 2: [Secondary Feature]
1. [Step by step flow]
2. [Include decision points]
3. [Note error handling]

### Flow 3: [Additional Feature]
1. [Step by step flow]

## Navigation Flow
- **Home/Dashboard** → [describe navigation options]
- **Feature Pages** → [how users move between features]
- **Back/Return** → [how users navigate back]

## Error Recovery
- **Connection Issues**: [How app handles offline/connectivity]
- **Invalid Input**: [How system guides user to correct input]
- **System Errors**: [How app communicates technical problems]

## Mobile Considerations
- [How flows adapt to mobile screens]
- [Touch interactions and gestures]
- [Mobile-specific navigation patterns]
