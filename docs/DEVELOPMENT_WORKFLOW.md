# Development Workflow

## Ideal Project Development Process

### Phase 1: Planning & Documentation ðŸ“‹

1. **Project Initialization**
   ```bash
   ./setup/init-project.sh
   ```

2. **Gather Requirements**
   - Business stakeholder interviews
   - User research and personas
   - Competitive analysis
   - Update `docs/specifications/requirements.md`

3. **Create User Stories**
   - Write detailed user stories with acceptance criteria
   - Prioritize features (MoSCoW method)
   - Update `docs/specifications/user-stories.md`

4. **Design User Experience**
   - Create user flow diagrams â†’ `docs/design/user-flow.md`
   - Design wireframes â†’ `docs/design/wireframes/`
   - Create high-fidelity mockups â†’ `docs/design/mockups/`
   - Define style guide â†’ `docs/design/style-guide.md`

5. **Define Business Logic**
   - Document workflows â†’ `docs/business-logic/workflows.md`
   - Define business rules â†’ `docs/business-logic/rules.md`
   - Specify calculations â†’ `docs/business-logic/calculations.md`

6. **Architecture Planning**
   - Choose tech stack â†’ `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md`
   - Design system architecture â†’ `docs/architecture/system-design.md`
   - Plan database schema â†’ `docs/architecture/database-schema.md`
   - Plan deployment â†’ `docs/architecture/deployment.md`

### Phase 2: Documentation Review âœ…

1. **Generate Build Prompt**
   ```bash
   ./setup/build-from-docs.sh
   ```

2. **Review Generated Prompt**
   ```bash
   cat claude-build-prompt.md
   ```

3. **Ensure Complete Documentation**
   - All wireframes uploaded and named clearly
   - Business logic documented with examples
   - Edge cases and error scenarios covered
   - API specifications defined

### Phase 3: Development with Claude ðŸ¤–

1. **Provide Complete Context to Claude**
   ```
   I have prepared comprehensive documentation for my project. 
   Please read the following files and build the application:
   
   [Paste content from claude-build-prompt.md]
   
   Additionally, please reference these wireframe files:
   - docs/design/wireframes/01-dashboard.png
   - docs/design/wireframes/02-transaction-form.png
   - docs/design/wireframes/03-category-management.png
   ```

2. **Claude Development Process**
   - Claude creates implementation plan
   - Sets up project structure
   - Implements backend following business rules
   - Builds frontend matching wireframes
   - Adds proper validation and error handling
   - Implements styling and responsive design

### Phase 4: Review & Iteration ðŸ”„

1. **Test Against Requirements**
   - Verify each requirement is met
   - Test all user stories
   - Check business logic implementation

2. **UI/UX Review**
   - Compare with wireframes/mockups
   - Test responsive design
   - Check accessibility

3. **Request Refinements**
   ```
   The application looks great! I'd like to make these refinements:
   1. The dashboard cards should use the color scheme from style-guide.md
   2. Add validation for the business rule in docs/business-logic/rules.md line 15
   3. Improve the mobile layout for the transaction list
   ```

## Benefits of This Approach

- Consistent user experience
- Proper business logic implementation

## Example Documentation Structure

```
docs/
â”œâ”€â”€ specifications/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.md        # "Users must be able to..."
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ user-stories.md       # "As a user, I want to..."
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ api-spec.yaml         # OpenAPI specification
â”œâ”€â”€ design/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ wireframes/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 01-dashboard.png
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 02-transactions.png
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 03-categories.png
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ style-guide.md        # Colors: #667eea, Fonts: Inter
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ user-flow.md         # Login â†’ Dashboard â†’ Add Transaction
â”œâ”€â”€ business-logic/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ workflows.md         # Transaction approval process
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ rules.md            # Budget limits, validation rules
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ calculations.md     # Balance = Income - Expenses
â””â”€â”€ architecture/
    â”œâ”€â”€ tech-stack.md       # React + FastAPI + PostgreSQL
    â”œâ”€â”€ database-schema.md  # Table structures, relationships
    â””â”€â”€ deployment.md       # Docker, AWS, CI/CD
```

This approach ensures Claude has everything needed to build exactly what you envision!
