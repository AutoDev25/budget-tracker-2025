## 🚀 How to Use This Template

### Step 1: Prepare Your Documentation

Before asking Claude to build your application, place your documentation in the appropriate folders:

1. **Wireframes** → `docs/design/wireframes/`
   - Upload PNG, JPG, or PDF files
   - Name them descriptively (e.g., `01-dashboard.png`, `02-transaction-list.png`)

2. **Specifications** → `docs/specifications/`
   - Create markdown files with detailed requirements
   - Include user stories, acceptance criteria

3. **Business Logic** → `docs/business-logic/`
   - Document workflows, rules, and calculations
   - Include examples and edge cases

### Step 2: Create Your Specification Files

#### Example: requirements.md
```markdown
# Budget Tracker Requirements

## Functional Requirements
1. Users can add income and expense transactions
2. Users can categorize transactions
3. Users can set budget limits per category
4. System calculates running balance
5. Users can filter by date range

## Non-Functional Requirements
1. Response time < 200ms
2. Support 1000+ transactions
3. Mobile responsive
4. Accessibility compliant (WCAG 2.1)
```

#### Example: user-stories.md
```markdown
# User Stories

## Story 1: Add Transaction
As a user, I want to add a new transaction
So that I can track my spending

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Can enter amount, description, date
- [ ] Can select category
- [ ] Can mark as income or expense
- [ ] Shows confirmation after saving
```

#### Example: workflows.md
```markdown
# Business Workflows

## Transaction Entry Workflow
1. User clicks "Add Transaction"
2. System displays form
3. User enters details
4. System validates:
   - Amount > 0
   - Date not in future
   - Category exists
5. System saves transaction
6. System updates balance
7. System shows confirmation
```

### Step 3: Initialize Your Project
