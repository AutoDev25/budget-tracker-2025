# budget-2025 - Claude Configuration

## Project Overview
This is a budget-2025 built with React + Vite frontend and FastAPI backend, designed for Mac home development.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18+ with TypeScript, Vite for development
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python) with SQLAlchemy
- **Database**: SQLite for development
- **Styling**: CSS3 with modern patterns
- **Development**: Hot reload, modular architecture

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: Located in `frontend/` directory
- **Backend**: Located in `backend/` directory
- **Components**: Modular React components in `frontend/src/components/`
